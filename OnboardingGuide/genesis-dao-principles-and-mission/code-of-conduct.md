# Code Of Conduct

#### Genesis DAO wide agreements, passed on Alchemy. <a id="h.p_kpL8c259v_iG"></a>

### Mutual Respect and Responsibility / No Sheep - No Shepherds. <a id="h.p_8xxu3EIDwCuh"></a>

Care less to what you take and much more to what you give.

**Respect People’s differences.** Each of us may approach life and relationship differently. While it may be a challenge for some of us to interact with people who don’t think the way we do, everyone deserves to have his or her feelings and values respected.

**Respect People's trust**. To fund proposals is an act of DAO\`s good faith. All of us are contributing to achieve a common purpose, so one's failure to spend funds properly and productively undermines all the other efforts and community's ambition as a whole. Concentrate on deliverables.

**Respect People’s time.** We are all living under pressure and deadlines. Remember that each of us has a different style of living, so respect your co-workers’ style of time management and prioritizing their workload.

**Respect People's opinion.** Why should I respect other people's opinions if they're just wrong? Because 'being right' is very subjective. We are all different and depending on our social background, education, experience and circumstances. Just because you think you are right does not mean that others are wrong. Stay curious and attentive, try to see life from different positions.

**Respect People's right to be aware.** Discuss your concern before you take actions. Let people know the subject matter of discussion and do it beforehand so to give a reasonable amount of time to enter a dialogue and raise a voice.
