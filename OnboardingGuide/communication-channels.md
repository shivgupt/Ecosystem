## Genesis DAO community call

Every **Tuesday at 5pm CET** we host a community call on Zoom where we can see and talk to each other. We follow an introduction, updates and breakout rooms structure.

**Intros** - New members can quickly introduce themselves. 

**Updates** - Anyone can share updates from proposals and work development and also communicate blocks and needs. 

**Breakout rooms** - are a chance for people who are working on a proposal or who want to address a key topic in Genesis to host a 30 min video zoom within the community call. Those who are interested in that subject join the room.
