# I Want To Create A DAO

#### We currently have 3 ways where you can get started with your DAO!

### **1-** DAOstack bizdev support

The DAOstack's bizdev team can help you from the very beginning until the deployment of your DAO. Although, due to high demand, this process might take some time to start. 

You can fill up this [DAO form ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedkvfFK1rsXcDUL3DCDcl5Wx1nOh2S0tb5P_xQdDlSjqsLZg/viewform)and wait to be contacted soon. These questions will also help you to understand some of the information you will need. 

### **2-** The DAO Creator

dOrg is a self organized developer community that started in the Genesis DAO.

They developed a [DAO creator](https://dorg.tech/#/dapp) wizard where you can deploy a DAO without a technical background. This tool is for advanced users only since it is still in Alpha phase.

### 3- The Hackers Kit 

If you' re a developer you can use the hacker's kit to deploy a DAO in few minutes.
