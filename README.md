# DAOstack Collaboration
This is a public repository to help coordinate collaboration across teams working in the DAOstack ecosystem. It serves as a  participatory roadmap that shows where the stack is headed, what needs to be done and who is doing what. It's also a place where teams can get on-boarded, connect with one another and share updates.

# How to Use this Repo
This repo facilitates collaboration via issue and proposal tracking. Essentially, the problems and ideas which we believe to be important will appear on the Issues tab. Projects that were funded through Genesis proposals will appear in the proposals folder.

- [**Issues**](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/issues) (Community Wishlist): Find projects to work on or suggest new ones.
- [**Proposals**](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/tree/master/proposals): See passed proposals or add your own. Proposals for dev funding should be added to this folder via a PR which will be merged once the proposal is passed by Genesis DAO
- [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/wiki): Learn about the broader direction of the stack.

## How to submit a proposal for grants

All grants proposals must be submitted directly to the Genesis DAO and must be passed by the Genesis members to get funded.

This repo is used to coordinate and reduce information asymmetries for developers builders in the DAOstack ecosystem.

  - Choose from the list of [Open Issues](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/issues) or work on your idea if you think it aligns with the Community's goal
  - Use the [Proposal template](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/blob/master/proposals/_template.md) to create your own proposal document.
  - Create new PR to [DAOstack-collab repo](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/pulls) to add your proposal document
  - Create a new Contribution proposal in [Genesis DAO](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/scheme/0x28c5b9efd5bdec2c69c613d2df4b5e1b92e44a2d3c2f5092fb45187570029009/proposals/create/) and `link to PR in the URL section` of the proposal
